Reference Materials
===================

λ-Calculus Reference Materials
------------------------------

* Peter Selinger's Lecture notes on the lambda calculus, http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3434

* Blelloch and Harper, λ-Calculus: The Other Turing Machine,
  manuscript: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/lctotm/cs50.pdf
  slides: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/talks/cs50talk.pdf

* http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~iosif/LogicAutomata07/lambda-calculus-slides.pdf
  (Nice slide deck, I used it in class)

* A Tutorial Introduction to the Lambda Calculus, by Raúl Rojas,
  http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf (9 pages of
  summary, with some problems for the reader.)

* Introduction to Lambda Calculus, by Henk Barendregt and Erik
  Barendsen,
  http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/TypesSS05/Extra/geuvers.pdf
  (53 pages, rather technical treatment includes proofs and diagrams,
  includes the Typed λ-Calculus.)

* A short introduction to the Lambda Calculus, by Achim Jung
  http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axj/pub/papers/lambda-calculus.pdf
  (10 very readable pages, with historic context and intuitions and
  exercises.)

* Lambda-calculus: Types and Models, by Jean-Louis Krivine, translated
  from French by René Cori,
  http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~krivine/articles/Lambda.pdf
  (Full-length 206-page book, and an excellent one too!  Ends by
  formulating and proving Gödel's Theorem in λ-Calculus instead of the
  usual Turing Machine formulation.)
